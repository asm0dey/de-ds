## Building

To build you have to have nodejs installed. You can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

After that you have to have pnpm installed:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

And after that build the project itself:

```
pnpm install
```

## Development

The presentations is built with [marp](https://marp.app/). The most comfortable way to work with Marp is to use a [VS Code's extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode)

Open the project with vscode with installed extension, call <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on Mac) and select "Open locked Preview to the side their". It will render and constantly update the presentation.
